```
Subject: Quick favor - 2 min testimonial for StartupMatch?

Hi [Name],

I noticed you've been active on StartupMatch and wanted to ask a quick favor.

We're updating our testimonials section with real founder stories (instead of generic ones), and your experience would be incredibly valuable.

Would you be willing to share:
- 2-3 sentences about your experience finding co-founders
- Your role/industry (we can anonymize if needed)  
- A professional photo or LinkedIn headshot

In return, I'd love to give you 3 months of premium features and feature your story prominently.

Takes 5 minutes, helps other founders discover the platform.

Interested?

Best,
[Your name]
```

#### **Email Template 2: Successful Matches**
```
Subject: Success story spotlight - StartupMatch feature?

Hi [Name],

Congratulations on connecting through StartupMatch! I heard through [source] that you and [co-founder] are working together now.

Would you be open to sharing your story as a featured testimonial? We're moving away from generic testimonials to real founder experiences.

What we'd need:
- Your story (2-3 paragraphs about the matching process)
- Professional headshot  
- Permission to mention your LinkedIn/company (or keep anonymous)

In return:
- Featured founder spotlight on homepage
- Premium features for both you and your co-founder
- LinkedIn endorsement/recommendation from me

Your story could help other founders who are struggling to find the right co-founder.

Let me know if you're interested!

Best,
[Your name]  
```
